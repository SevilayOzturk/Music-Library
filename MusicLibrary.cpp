////implement the public function 'playRandom' which plays all songs of the library ( by invoking the play function of each song) in pseudo-random fashion by alternating songs from the beginning and from the end of the list, until all songs have been played. For example, if the library has 7 songs, the songs will be played in the following order: 0, 6, 1, 5, 2, 4, 3
//implement the public function addSongToPlayList which stores a pointer to a song in the library in the array of Song pointer. The input to this method is an integer denoting the position of the song in the MusicLibrary
//If the Playlist is full, print the following error message
//
//Could not add Song to PlayList. PlayList is full
//If the integer denoting the position of a song in the MusicLibrary is invalid, print the following error message
//
//Invalid song
//implement the public function 'playPlaylist' which plays the songs in the playlist in the same order as the songs have been added to the playlist.
//A sample main file has been provided showing the utilization of the functions, as well as a sample input file.
